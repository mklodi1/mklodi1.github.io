About Me
======
I am a Quantitative Biomedicine PhD Candidate at Rutgers University with experience in next-generation sequencing, structural variation, computational biology, and neurodevelopmental disorders. On the technical side, I build computational pipelines integrating bioinformatics tools and methods to analyze genomic variation. I currently work in the Xing Lab of Genomics under the mentorship of Dr. Jinchuan Xing, where I develop and apply computational methods to identify candidate risk genes associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder and associated neurodevelopmental disorders. 

I earned my BS in Bioinformatics from Virginia Commonwealth University in 2021. In my free time, I enjoy playing sports, drawing, reading, cooking, and photography.
